=>Pure Component:
Pure Components are Class Components which extends React.PureComponent. 

Generally, In ReactJS, we use shouldComponentUpdate() Lifecycle method to customize the default behavior and implement it when the React component should re-render or update itself.
Now, ReactJS has provided us a Pure Component. If we extend a class with Pure Component, there is no need for shouldComponentUpdate() Lifecycle Method. ReactJS Pure Component Class compares current state and props with new props and states to decide whether the React component should re-render itself or  Not.
In simple words, If the previous value of state or props and the new value of state or props is the same, the component will not re-render itself. Since Pure Components restricts the re-rendering when there is no use of re-rendering of the component.

Functional component did not re-render if state is not changed.

=>HOC:
A higher-order component (HOC) is an advanced technique in React for reusing component logic. HOCs are not part of the React API, per se.
They are a pattern that emerges from Reactâ€™s compositional nature.
We can use HOC in styling,markups authentiaction etc

We can give style of HOC to its children as in profile and profile layout in code.
We can block rendering of children if some condition not met like authorization etc as in code
