npm start=>in my app use for starting the development server(like liveserver)

Bundle:
u shouldnt send all js files to server when u put website on production.use command to will create a bundle
All our js files=>transpile=>index.html and bundle.js

Transpiling is a specific term for taking source code written in one language and transforming into another language that has a similar level of abstraction.

Now delete all files in src and we ll build react app froms scratch
