bundle
All our js files=>transpile=>index.html and bundle.js
Transpiling is a specific term for taking source code written in one language and transforming into
another language that has a similar level of abstraction.

=>BUILDING REACT APP FROM SCRATCH

Now delete all files in src and we ll build react app froms scratch:
First thing index.js is required for the npm start.All our logic is in index.js.
We have index.html file in public folder that contains html and logic is in index.js
if we empty our index.js then blank screen will appear.

=>WHATS INSIDE IN INDEX.JS?

import React from 'react'; >Every time u build u have to include this
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'; >to connect out index.js and index.html file (How to read DOM and cnnect with index.html)
